# Affine Transformation Documentation  

## Introduction  

Affine transformation is a linear mapping method that preserves points, straight lines, and planes.  
One of its key properties is that sets of parallel lines remain parallel after the transformation.  

### Basic Transformations  
Affine transformations can be broken down into three fundamental types:  
1. **Translation** – Moving an object from one position to another without altering its orientation or size.  
2. **Scaling** – Adjusting the size of an object, either enlarging or shrinking, while maintaining its proportions.  
3. **Rotation** – Rotating an object around a fixed point or axis.  

This documentation covers practical implementations of affine transformations through 11 laboratory exercises.
